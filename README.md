# My journey as iOS Developer
Hello! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Beni Garcia, an iOS Developer participated at the ï£¿ Apple Developer Academy Cohort 6. While in the academy, i've developed bunch of application that i created using Swift Language. 

## Tiati
Tiati is an iOS app designed to avert microsleep during driving by analyzing different parameters through the iPhone's camera. Parameters detected using Vision to detect eye blink, yawn, and head tilt. The app utilizes a Random Forest model, trained with CreateML, to assess the user's level of drowsiness.

I mostly contributed in Vision to track face parameter to detect blink, yawn, and head tilt. I also contributed in core data to manage the data relation between entities then show it as chart using SwiftCharts.

## Adventure Quest

"Adventure Quest" is an application that I created solo as a developer. It is a gamification iOS app that challenges players to visit various places near them. The app uses MapKit to detect nearby places related to user input, and users can complete quests by taking photos of those locations. AVFoundation is used to capture images, and Core Data is utilized to save data such as progress and images that users have already taken.

## MRTuTut
In this project, our primary goal revolved around addressing issues within the MRT ecosystem, benefiting both passengers and staff members. Our team opted to concentrate on passenger concerns, ultimately selecting the real-time feature update approach. This feature aimed to provide passengers with live updates on station conditions and nearby events. To realize this, we seamlessly integrated Firebase for database management, employed geolocation services, and incorporated user notifications throughout the development phase.
